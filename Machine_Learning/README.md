## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have an environment with PyTorch, and RAPIDS.

(We will include an environment that can be downloaded soon hopefully).

## Training & Evaluation

This repository has a jupyter notebook with an extensive set of model generation and evaluation abilities. The models are designed to be extremely modular to facilitate hyper-parameter selection.

Similarly, the modularity also makes it easy to generate and evaluate a model using a simple configuration dictionary.

## Deployment

TBD ...
