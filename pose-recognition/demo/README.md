Before running the MOCAP script, some things to take note of:

The models are sensitive to the user's environments, so please make sure to palce yourself in a well-lit, isolated environment. Confusing the model can be easy, especially if objects or environment features include

1) Reflective Objects
2) Skin-Colored Objects
3) Many Objects

Furthermore, in the example script, because of this confusion, sometimes the model will prioritize random things, and adjusting the number of bounding boxes depending on how chaotic the environment is may be necessary.
