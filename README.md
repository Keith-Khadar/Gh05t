## Project Overview

This project aims to design and develop an EEG headset. The headset will have a compact design, integrated into a removable hat to provide comfort and discreteness. It will be equipped with at least 4 electrodes with the modularity to add additional electrodes if required/desired. The electrodes will connect to an ADC purpose designed for measuring weak signals. The samples generated by the ADC will be sampled by a micro-controller. Using an ESP32 (Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6), we can communicate wirelessly and sample at high frequency rates for a low cost. It will communicate with a computer for analysis by a machine learning (ML) model to detect gestures or possibly speech; potentially adding integration with Virtual-Reality. Lastly, the system will also interface with a GUI, allowing users to visualize the EEG data in real-time. We can leverage multiple open-source libraries available through OpenBCI and PiEEG for displaying the GUI.

## Known Bugs

- ~~**Pose ML Model Offset**: The pose recognition machine learning model offsets the generated skeleton by a set amount. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c28c0a2e-da3d-4fa4-a920-4a78a1bb0804)~~

## Difficulties/Challenges

- **3D Printing Fail**: Weak legs on 3D electrodes
  - The initial model found and used for the electrodes has spindly legs. In combination with two snaps of the filament during printing, the legs were incredibly weak and many snapped during removal from the print bed.
  - Fix: Load filament onto spool to eliminate snapping during print. Custom design electrodes with filleted legs to enhance their strength. Increase the number of walls when slicing model for printing.
  - Above fix solved combined with printing on a higher quality printer and in a different orientation fixed the issues. 
- **Snap Plating**: Purchased snaps are covered in non-conductive coating
  - Prevented soldering, but can be scrapped off with a knife.
  - Reduces signal integritty of electrodes.
  - Fix: Looking into alternative unplated snap connectors.
  - Above fix solves the issue in initial testing. Will continue to monitor as further testing is conducted.
- **Inaccurate EEG Data**: Data recorded during initial testing is inaccurate.
  - The poor quality electrodes(see snap plating challenge & 3d printing fail) as well as the ADC optimized for Electromyography (EMG) data recording instead of the use case of Electroencephalography (EEG), resulted in poor quality data.
  - Fix: Custom designed PCB breakout board for the ADS1299 which is designed for EEG data acquisition.
  - Update: Fix in progress
- **Reflow Issus**: Solder pads bridged during reflow of PCB.
  - Fix: Use flux and a hand solder iron to fix individual pads OR reattempt the reflow.
  - Update: Fix in progress
- **PCB Data Collection**: Unable to reliably collect data through SPI from the PCB breakout board.
  - The ADS1299 breakout board fails to reliably begin data collection/transmission when request through the Start pin. Data collection occasionally can be started by connecting the Start and Reset pins, but this is highly inconsistent.
  - Update: More testing in progress
